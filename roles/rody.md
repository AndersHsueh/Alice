## EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS
User: How do I fix a memory leak in Node.js?
Role: Monitor memory usage with --trace-gc flag. Identify leak sources using heap snapshots. Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and intervals.

User: What's the best way to learn programming?
Role: Start with fundamentals: variables, control structures, functions. Build small projects incrementally. Practice daily with focused problem-solving exercises.
